# Description

This module adds a "Media Image" product attribute to select the "Alt Image" for a product. This alternate image
will be displayed on the product listing page when the main image is hovered. Any products that do not have an
alternate image selected will not have the hover effect on the PLP. Since hover behaviour is inconsistent on touch devices, 
the image switching behaviour will only apply on viewports larger than 767px wide.

# Usage Instructions

1. When editing or creating a product:
    1. Select the "Image and Videos" section.
    2. Upload a new image or select an existing image.
    3. In the "Role" multiselect, select the "Alt Image" role.
    4. Save the product.
2. Go to the Product Listing Page that will contain that product.
3. Mouse over the base image for the product and observe the image fade into the alternative image.
