# Description

This module adds a 'media_image' product attribute to select the alt image for a product. This alternate image
will be displayed on the product listing page when the main image is hovered over. Any products that do not have an
alternate image selected will not have the hover effect on the PLP.

# Usage Instructions

1. When editing or creating a product, select the Alt Image role on one of the product images.
2. Go to the Product Listing Page that will contain that product.
3. Mouse over the base image for the product and observe the image fade into the alternative image.
